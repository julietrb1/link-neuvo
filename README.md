This is a little spare-time/hobby project born out of the desire to help a friend maintaining their website to figure out if they had any broken links (of which they apparently have plenty).

This README is far from complete, but it shouldn't take too long to get the hang of this (currently) quaint little console application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 6
- The page you want to start crawling from
  - Preferably with the rights to do so, because we don't want you getting blocked or flagged!
- A terminal or IDE handy to run the application

1. Clone this repository.
2. Build the LinkNeuvo project.
3. Adjust settings in appsettings.json as necessary (as they should be relatively intuitive).
4. Run the LinkNeuvo project, and the console output should keep you well-informed.
